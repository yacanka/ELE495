# TOBB University of Economics and Technology ELE 495 Robot Arm Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop an object classification robot using a robotic arm and Nvidia Jetson Nano kit. This robot will utilize image processing and artificial intelligence technologies to identify and classify a specific number and variety of objects, then place them into respective bins, and display the entire process on a web interface.
